【Exception】
    Format1:
        try:
            Statement1
        except error1 as e:
            Statement2
        except error2 as e:
            Statement3
        ...
        [else:
            StatementN]

    Format2:
        try:
            Statement1
        except error1 as e:
            Statement2
        except error2 as e:
            Statement3
        ...
        finally:
            StatementN

    analyze:
        Used to detect errors in the try block, allowing the exception statement to catch errors and process them.

    Attention:
        1) Mistake are actually a class. All mistakes extend BaseException.
        2) When you cross a multilayer call, you can throw an exception as long as the final call is captured.
